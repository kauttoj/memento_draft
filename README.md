This repository contains Matlab codes related to Memento article manuscript. In the initial commit codes are not particularly well organized and commented. This will be fixed in upcoming commits. Repo also does not contain large results files or fMRI datasets (dozens of gigabytes). These will be made available elsewhere at later stage (depends on ethical permissions). At moment, selected result maps acan be found at neurovault.org/collections/2292.
